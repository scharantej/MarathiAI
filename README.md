## Flask Application Design for Marathi Language Learning Assistant

**HTML Files**
- `index.html`: Main page of the application, serving as a landing page or dashboard for the user.
- `lessons.html`: Contains the Marathi language lessons organized in a structured manner.
- `practice.html`: Provides interactive exercises and quizzes for users to practice their Marathi skills.
- `progress.html`: Tracks the user's progress through the lessons and exercises.

**Routes**
- `/`: Directs to the `index.html` page, serving as the home page.
- `/lessons`: Displays the `lessons.html` page, presenting structured Marathi lessons.
- `/practice`: Renders the `practice.html` page, providing interactive exercises and quizzes.
- `/progress`: Redirects to the `progress.html` page, which displays the user's progress.

**Additional Considerations**
- The application could incorporate audio pronunciations and translations to enhance language immersion.
- A feedback mechanism can be added to gather user input and improve the learning experience.
- To accommodate diverse learners, the application could include multiple levels of difficulty for lessons and practice exercises.
